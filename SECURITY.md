## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please Note:** This is a hobby project targeted to run on trusted internal networks. Authentication/Authorization features are implemented for identity control and access management, and while it _MAY_ be sufficient in more hostile environments, it is not built with that as a primary goal.

### Low Risk / Non-Critical Issues
For most issues (e.g., minor bugs, enhancements, or theoretical vulnerabilities that require significant access or specific conditions), please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/brwyatt/dffmpeg/issues).

### Critical Vulnerabilities
If you discover a critical vulnerability that could actively put users at risk (e.g., unauthenticated RCE, trivial auth bypass on exposed ports), please report it via email to **brwyatt+dffmpeg-security@gmail.com**.

I will make a best-effort attempt to review and address critical reports, but please understand this is a side project without a dedicated security team or SLA.
