## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please Note:** This is a hobby project targeted to run on trusted internal networks. Authentication/Authorization features are implemented for identity control and access management, and while it _MAY_ be sufficient in more hostile environments, it is not built with that as a primary goal.

### Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it via [GitHub Private Reporting](https://github.com/brwyatt/dffmpeg/security/advisories/new).

I will make a best-effort attempt to review and address reports, but please understand this is a side project without a dedicated security team or SLA.

### Other Issues
For non-security bugs and enhancements, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/brwyatt/dffmpeg/issues).
